To formally state what this project is about, I am going to analyze grocery transaction data with two complementaty unsupervised learning techniques to uncover meaningful product paterns. One method will be a technique we learned in class, **Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)** to identify latent product groupings, which will reveal hidden structure in shopper's purchasing habits. The other method will be new, **association rule mining** using the **Apriori** algrorithm to find items that are frequently purchased together. These two approaches can provide insights into product categories and practical retail product placement ideas.# unsupervised-learning-final-project
